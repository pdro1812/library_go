## Specification

You should implement an application for a library to store book and authors data.

**This application must provide an HTTP REST API to attend the requirements.**

### 1. Receive a CSV with authors and import to database

Given a CSV file with many authors (more than a million), you need to build a command to import the data into the database. The CSV file will have the following format:

```
name
Luciano Ramalho
Osvaldo Santana Neto
David Beazley
Chetan Giridhar
Brian K. Jones
J.K Rowling
```

Each author record in the database must have the following fields:

* id (self-generated)
* name

You need to store the authors' data to complement the book data that will be stored afterward (see item #3).

_Extra tip: If you use Django Framework you can do something like this..._

```
python manage.py import_authors authors.csv
```

### 2. Expose authors' data in an endpoint

This endpoint needs to return a paginated list with the authors' data. Optionally the authors can be searched by name.

### 3. CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete) of books

You need to implement these actions in your API:

* Create a book
* Read book's data
* Update book's data
* Delete book's data

Each book record has the fields:

* id (self-generated)
* name
* edition
* publication_year
* authors (more than one author can write a book)

To retrieve a book (in easy mode) we can filter by 4 fields (or a composition of these four):

* name
* publication_year
* edition
* author

But these 4 filters are optional. It must be possible to navigate all the books' data without any filter.

To create a book you need to send this payload (in json format) below:

```
{
 "name": // Name of the book;
 "edition": // Edition number;
 "publication_year": // Publication year of the book;
 "authors": // List of author ids, same ids of previous imported data
}
```
